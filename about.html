        <p>     Yung Cortex AKA Cody Littlefield, <br>began making music at the age of 12. A friend of his showed him FL studio while at the 
            skatepark one day. Cody loved it and started trying to make music. He has had many different aliases, the first being YouAreMyFavoriteFood. <br>
            Next was Aqua Nintendo, then it became DJ Phillie, and then it became Cortex. Early on he then changed it to Yung Cortex and it has been 
            that ever since. <br>
            In the beginning, he was very inspired by IDM and metal music. With influences of Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Kid606 and things of that sort, to a wide range of 
            death metal and grindcore music. It began with making lots of really bad techno and "computer metal" music. After spending years doing that,<br>
            he started getting into rap music like Three 6 Mafia, and lots of other memphis rappers. From there, he began to make rap beats, some of his friends would rap
            around him and they would be like "Make a beat!" so, he did.
            <br> This began the birth of Yung Cortex, he began producing for people in the underground rap scene such as SG Rilla Mane, Amber London, Eddy Baker, SnobMobb,<br>
            Cashy, Seed of 6ix, Pollari and more. Once he left New Hampshire to move to California and persue his producing career he linked up with Lil Peep and Lil Tracy.<br>
            They lived and worked together to produce many songs, just some normal artist & producer stuff. 
            <br> After making many hits with them and many other artists, Cortex has began working on his own music a lot more focusing on singing, and guitar.<br>
            <br> Between 2017-Now Cortex has dropped many vocal projects and has begand to focus on creating music that is fully created and produced by just himself.
            In 2022 he relased "Time Won't Stop" and since has been working on lots more indie type of music. There is lots more to come in 2023. <br>
            In 2023 he has focused on learning how to code in many languages, but specifically in Swift. He began developing a meditation app for IOS that will be relased shortly<br>
            The app includes hours of ambient music created by him, for you to listen to whenever youd like.
